Filament dryer monitoring system

In an effort to keep 3D Printing filament dry, I constructed a "dry box."

I am experimenting with different methods to maintain conditions inside the box and possibly even actively dry filament.

To measure the effectiveness of each method I created a simple system to monitor temprature and humidity and record the values to Adaruit IO.

This system is built on an Adafruit Feather M0 Wifi with an I2C temp/humidity sensor.

Construction details coming soon.
